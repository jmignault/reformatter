Python script to convert Word files to PDF in a folder. PDFs are
written to a subfolder named 'processed' and a timestamped log is kept
in the initial folder.

The script requires that soffice be installed and on the executable
path. On Windows, the directory parameter needs to be a full double-quoted path. The script works with standard Python 3 libraries and requires Python 3.
